### GDB commands
From CMU 15-213 `rec04.pdf`.  

- break `<location>`  
Stop execution at function name or address  
Reset breakpoints when restarting gdb 
- run `<args>`
Run program with args `<args>`
- disas `<fun>`, but not dis
- stepi(si) / nexti(ni)  
Steps would step into function calls.  
Next would not enter function.
- info registers  
Print hex values in every register
- print (/x or /d) $eax  
Print hex or decimal contents of %eax  
- x `$register`, x `0xaddress`   
Prints whatâ€™s in the register / at the given address  
By default, prints one word (4 bytes)  
Specify format: /s, /[num][size][format]  
`x/8a 0x15213`  
`x/4wd 0xdeadbeef`  

`cmpl`: The `cmpl` instruction compares the contents of general-purpose register (GPR) RA with the contents of GPR RB as unsigned integers and sets one of the bits in Condition Register Field BF.  

`[f000:e05b]    0xfe05b: cmpl   $0x0, %cs:0x6ac8`. Compare 0 with the the value stored at memory location represented by `cs:0x6ac8` (the `segment:offset` notation). 

### Exercise 2
Use GDB's `si` (Step Instruction) command to trace into the ROM BIOS for a few more instructions, and try to guess what it might be doing. You might want to look at Phil Storrs I/O Ports Description, as well as other materials on the 6.828 reference materials page. No need to figure out all the details - just the general idea of what the BIOS is doing first.

- Real mode  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode#:~:targetText=Real%20mode%2C%20also%20called%20real,O%20addresses%20and%20peripheral%20hardware.  
Real mode, also called real address mode, is an operating mode of all x86-compatible CPUs. Real mode is characterized by a 20-bit segmented memory address space (giving exactly 1 MiB of addressable memory) and unlimited direct software access to all addressable memory, I/O addresses and peripheral hardware. Real mode provides no support for memory protection, multitasking, or code privilege levels.  
In real mode (the mode that PC starts off in), address translation works according to the formula with `(segment:offset)` address: `physical address = 16 * segment + offset`.

https://qiita.com/kagurazakakotori/items/b092fc0dbe3c3ec09e8e  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/36926462  
This is also described in detail in the xv6 book appendix B.


- Protection mode  
At this point you only have to understand that translation of segmented addresses (segment:offset pairs) into physical addresses happens differently in protected mode, and that after the transition offsets are 32 bits instead of 16.

- Reading `boot.S` and `main.c`

https://blackdragonf.github.io/2017/12/09/MIT6-828%E6%93%8D%E4%BD%9C%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8BLab1-Booting-a-PC%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A/
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/36926462

### Exercise 3
- At what point does the processor start executing 32-bit code? What exactly causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode?  

   Use gdb to trace through `obj/boot/boot.asm`. Set a break point at address `0x7c00` with `b *0x7c00`. Then use `c` to reach the break point. And then use `x/[n]i` to inspect instruction. The first tens of lines are very similar to `boot.S`. By reading the comment in `boot.S`, you know 32-bit protection mode is enabled at `movl    %eax, %cr0`, where the `%cr0` register is set. In gdb, you see the code at `0x7c2a:	mov    %eax,%cr0`.  
   However, the xv6 book appendix B would tell your that it is the next jump instruction `ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg` that cause the switch effectively. 

- What is the last instruction of the boot loader executed, and what is the first instruction of the kernel it just loaded?  

   Reading `boot.S`, you see it calls function `bootmain` in `main.c`. So you easily guess the last instruction of boot loader should be the assembly code of last instruction of `bootmain` function in `main.c`.   
   In `boot.asm`, you see `00007d15 <bootmmain>`. The function end at `7d6b:	ff 15 18 00 01 00    	call   *0x10018`. Set a breakpoint at that command `b *0x7d6b` and `c`. Then we get:
   ```
   (gdb) b *0x7d6b
   Breakpoint 2 at 0x7d6b
   (gdb) c
   Continuing.
   The target architecture is assumed to be i386
   => 0x7d6b:	call   *0x10018
   ```
   So the last instruction of the boot loader is `call   *0x10018`, and the first instruciton of the loaded kernel the code located at **the address stored at (!!)** `0x10018`.  

   https://www.jianshu.com/p/84f62a05a7e6 Use `x/8x 0x10000` to inspect the content at `0x10018`, we get:
   ```
   (gdb) x/8x 0x10000
   0x10000:	0x464c457f	0x00010101	0x00000000	0x00000000
   0x10010:	0x00030002	0x00000001	0x0010000c	0x00000034
   ```
   So the value stored at `0x10018` is `0x0010000c`, this is the address of our next instruction. Use `x/i 0x10000c` to inpect, we get:
   ```
   (gdb) x/i 0x10000c
      0x10000c:	movw   $0x1234,0x472
   ```
   This is the first instruction of the loaded kernel.

   Note: this quetion is a bit tricky around the command `call *0x10018`. Look at the assembly code in gdb carefully, and you would notice that some `call` command is `call 0x----`, but this one has an `*` before the address. The asterisk means go to the address stored at `0x10018`. What makes this even more confusing is the way you specify break point in gdb: `break function` and `break *address`: https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gdb/html_node/gdb_28.html. The notation used by gdb has nothing to do with the notation used in assembly code at all! Keep this in mind!

- Where is the first instruction of the kernel?  
From the last question, you know the first instruction is located at `0x1000c`.  

- How does the boot loader decide how many sectors it must read in order to fetch the entire kernel from disk? Where does it find this information?
In `main.c`, `ph = (struct Proghdr *) ((uint8_t *) ELFHDR + ELFHDR->e_phoff); eph = ph + ELFHDR->e_phnum;`.  

### Exercise 4
Easy exercise on C pointers. Detailed explanation: https://qiita.com/kagurazakakotori/items/b092fc0dbe3c3ec09e8e  

### ELF Format
Read the content on ELF format very carefully.  

### Exercise 5
**Answer**   
Did not fully understand. Of course dismatching the link address and load address would cause problem.  

### Exercise 6
Examine the 8 words of memory at 0x00100000 at the point the BIOS enters the boot loader, and then again at the point the boot loader enters the kernel. Why are they different? What is there at the second breakpoint? 

**Answer**  
When BIOS starts, memory location starting from `0x100000` are not used and the content at that address is all 0's. When boot loader enters the kernel, there are some contents are address `0x100000`. Clearly this is because the kernel is loaded into the memory. This is also explained in xv6 book: `The memory from 0xa0000 to 0x100000 is typically littered with device memory regions, and the xv6 kernel expects to be placed at 0x100000`.

### Exercise 7
**Answer**   
Kernel code is usually linked and executed at a *high* virtual address, in order to leave the lower part of the virtual memory space to the user programs. However, many machines do not have enough physical memory and thus virtual memory is introduced.  
This switch from directly using physical memory address to using virtual memory address is achieved by setting the `CP0_PG` flag in `kern/entry.S`. Once `CR0_PG` is set, memory references are virtual addresses that get translated by the virtual memory hardware to physical addresses.  
At this point, only 4MB are mapped: virtual addresses in the range `0xf0000000` through `0xf0400000` are mapped to physical addresses `0x00000000` through `0x00400000`. Virtual addresses `0x00000000` through `0x00400000` are ALSO mapped to physical addresses `0x00000000` through `0x00400000`. Any virtual address that is not in one of these two ranges will cause a hardware exception which, since we haven't set up interrupt handling yet, will cause QEMU to dump the machine state and exit.

In `entry.S`, there is this code snippet:
```
movl	$(RELOC(entry_pgdir)), %eax
movl	%eax, %cr3

# Turn on paging.
movl	%cr0, %eax
orl	$(CR0_PE|CR0_PG|CR0_WP), %eax
movl	%eax, %cr0   <-- set the flag
```
Restart the emulator, remembering that the start of the kernel code is stored at address `*0x10080 == 0x10000c`. So `b *0x10000c`, `c`, and then
```
(gdb) x/10i 0x10000c
=> 0x10000c:	movw   $0x1234,0x472
   0x100015:	mov    $0x112000,%eax
   0x10001a:	mov    %eax,%cr3
   0x10001d:	mov    %cr0,%eax
   0x100020:	or     $0x80010001,%eax 
   0x100025:	mov    %eax,%cr0
   0x100028:	mov    $0xf010002f,%eax
   0x10002d:	jmp    *%eax
   0x10002f:	mov    $0x0,%ebp
```
Compare with `entry.S`, we know that `0x100025:	mov    %eax,%cr0` is the line that sets the `CR0_PG` flag. `b *0x100025`, `c`. At this point, we examine the memory address before and after executing this line:
```
(gdb) x/4x 0x100000
0x100000:	0x1badb002	0x00000000	0xe4524ffe	0x7205c766
(gdb) x/4x 0xf0100000
0xf0100000 <_start+4026531828>:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
(gdb) ni
=> 0x100028:	mov    $0xf010002f,%eax
0x00100028 in ?? ()
(gdb) x/4x 0xf0100000
0xf0100000 <_start+4026531828>:	0x1badb002	0x00000000	0xe4524ffe	0x7205c766
(gdb) x/4x 0x100000
0x100000:	0x1badb002	0x00000000	0xe4524ffe	0x7205c766
```
Before setting `CR0_PG`, `0x100000` and `0xf0100000` have different content. After `CR0_PG` is set, `0x00100000` and `0xf0100000` (different virtual memory addresses) maps to the same physical memory address and the result is the same.  

If this mapping is disabled, the instruction `0x10002d:	jmp    *%eax` would fail, because it accesses address `0xf010002f`, which should have been mapped to a physical address.  

### Exercise 8
- We have omitted a small fragment of code - the code necessary to print octal numbers using patterns of the form "%o". Find and fill in this code fragment.  

   Not a hard problem. Locate the code and consult the code within the same function, you easily get the solution:
   ```C
   case 'o':
			// Code by YY
			num = getint(&ap, lflag);
			base = 8;
			goto number;
   ```

1. Explain the interface between printf.c and console.c. Specifically, what function does console.c export? How is this function used by printf.c?
As stated in the comment in `printf.c` and `console.c`, `cputchar()` is provided by `console.c` and used by `printf.c`. Thus the underlying import and export are not fully understood.  

2. Explain the following from console.c:
   ```C
   if (crt_pos >= CRT_SIZE) {
      int i;
      memmove(crt_buf, crt_buf + CRT_COLS, (CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS) * sizeof(uint16_t));
      for (i = CRT_SIZE - CRT_COLS; i < CRT_SIZE; i++)
         crt_buf[i] = 0x0700 | ' ';
         crt_pos -= CRT_COLS;
      }
   ```
   Reading the function `cga_putc` carefully and guessing the meaning of `crt_buf`, `crt_pos`, `CRT_SIZE`, `CRT_COL`, this function is probably move all lines one row above when the console is full. About the constant `0x0700`, highly likely that the high order bits are controlling the FG and BG color of the text (https://stackoverflow.com/a/43221581/9057530).  

For the following questions you might wish to consult the notes for **Lecture 2**. These notes cover GCC's calling convention on the x86.  

3. Trace the execution of the following code step-by-step:
    ```C
    int x = 1, y = 3, z = 4;
    cprintf("x %d, y %x, z %d\n", x, y, z);
    ```
    - In the call to cprintf(), to what does fmt point? To what does ap point?

        The first problem is where to put the code? Recall that when qemu is started, there are some output in the window and what you just fixed is somewhere that uses `%o` format. Search through the file, you should see the function is `i386_init` in `kern/init.c`. 

        Copy the code into the function, `make`, and open gdb again. (Note that putting the code at the start of `i386_init` function causes error when starting the qume. Maybe it's because some setup work, like `cons_init()`, needs to be done. Putting the code before the `while` loop and it works.) Then
        ```
        (gdb) info function i386_init
        All functions matching regular expression "i386_init":

        File kern/init.c:
        void i386_init(void);
        (gdb) break i386_init
        Breakpoint 1 at 0xf01000a6: file kern/init.c, line 24.
        (gdb) c
        Continuing.
        The target architecture is assumed to be i386
        => 0xf01000a6 <i386_init>:	push   %ebp

        Breakpoint 1, i386_init () at kern/init.c:24
        24	{
        ``` 
        As you are inside a function, it is much easier to step through the code as you can use `disas function`. Use knowledge from gcc x86 calling convention, function prologue/epilogue to analyze the assembly.
        ```
        // Note: this is the assembly code where the code in inserted at the beginning of 
        // the i386_init function. However, the analysis is the same.

        gdb keeps giving "No symobl" error when trying to inspect `ap`, the 2nd argument, but we konw it is an `va_list`. You may also check the answer in this link: https://qiita.com/kagurazakakotori/items/b092fc0dbe3c3ec09e8e#exercise-8.  
    - List (in order of execution) each call to `cons_putc`, `va_arg`, and `vcprintf`. For `cons_putc`, list its argument as well. For `va_arg`, list what ap points to before and after the call. For `vcprintf` list the values of its two arguments.  
        - `cons_putc` is defined in `console.c`. `va_arg` is a macro defined in `stdarg.h`: `#define va_arg(ap, type) __builtin_va_arg(ap, type)`. `vcprintf` is defined in `print.c`.

        - For `va_arg`:  
            `va_arg` is defined as a macro and we get set breakpoint to it. Then we find that in `printfmt.c`, both `getint` and `getuint` use this macro.  
            The exact execution detail is not explored. Read https://www.jianshu.com/p/84f62a05a7e6 and https://qiita.com/kagurazakakotori/items/b092fc0dbe3c3ec09e8e#exercise-8 to get the idea. 

4. Run the following code.
   ```C
   unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
   cprintf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
   ```
    - What is the output? Explain how this output is arrived at in the step-by-step manner of the previous exercise.  
    
        Function execution is similar to the code above. `%s` is matched in the switch statement in `vprintfmt` in `printfmt.c`. The output is `He110 World`.  

    - The output depends on that fact that the x86 is little-endian. If the x86 were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change `57616` to a different value?  
        - big/little endian revisited  
            - when multi-byte data is put into memory, it is written to the lower memory address before going to higher address.  
            - Read the [link](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/big_endian.html).  
                Big endian: the most significant bit is stored first, i.e., in the lowest address.
                Little endian: the least significant bit is stored first, i.e., in the lowest address.  
        - In our case, `unsigned int i = 0x00646c72`. Refer to the ASCII table, `0x00`: `\0`, `0x64`: `d`, `0x6c`: `l`, `0x72`: `o`. By convention, x86 architecture uses little-endian and `0x72` is stored first and `0x00` is stored last. The value is stored as:
            ```
            4                   0
            +----+----+----+----+
            | 00 | 64 | 6c | 72 |
            +----+----+----+----+
            ```
        - If changed to big -endian, then should be changed to `0x726c6400`. For `57616`, though it is stored differently on under different endian, they are fetched to be the same and does not need to change.


5. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
    ```
    cprintf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
    ```
    The result is undefined. 

6. Let's say that GCC changed its calling convention so that it pushed arguments on the stack in declaration order, so that the last argument is pushed last. How would you have to change cprintf or its interface so that it would still be possible to pass it a variable number of arguments?  

    Reverse the order of input arguments in the C code.  

### Exercise 9
Determine where the kernel initializes its stack, and exactly where in memory its stack is located. How does the kernel reserve space for its stack? And at which "end" of this reserved area is the stack pointer initialized to point to?  

**Answer**  
Global search for `stack` in the directory, you find that in `entry.S`, we have the following: 
```
...
# Set the stack pointer
movl	$(bootstacktop),%esp

...

.data
###################################################################
# boot stack
###################################################################
	.p2align	PGSHIFT		# force page alignment
	.globl		bootstack
bootstack:
	.space		KSTKSIZE
	.globl		bootstacktop   
bootstacktop:
```
Guess this would be the code that allocates space for stack. This [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/q/33105872/9057530) confirms the thought. But what is the exact meanning of the code? Read this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32792778/9057530) from StackOverflow (quoted below).

> `.p2align` will align the page with the bootstack to whatever value is defined in PGSHIFT. `bootstack` is a label (**memory address**) that happens to have space allocated after it with `.space KSTKSIZE` (amount of space allocated = KSTKSIZE). The `.globl bootstacktop` directive simply says that this label will be made global (like a variable declared `extern` in C). `bootstackstop` is another label (memory address) that will be **the address just after the last byte in `bootstack`**. It is also declared globally for other objects to use. `bootstacktop - bootstack = KSTKSIZE`.   

As **`.data` segment grows from lower address to higher address**, `bootstacktop` would be the address of the top of the stack, i.e., `bootstacktop` is a pointer to the top of the stack, which is initially empty.  

**Answer**
- The `.space KSTKSIZE` in `entry.S` allocates space for kernel stack, and `movl	$(bootstacktop),%esp` in `entry.S` sets the stack pointer. 
- In `kernel.asm`, 
    ```
        # Set the stack pointer
        movl	$(bootstacktop),%esp
        f0100034:	bc 00 00 11 f0       	mov    $0xf0110000,%esp
    ```
    so the top of the stack, when initialized, is located at `0xf0110000`. And the bound is `bootstack`: `0xf0110000 - KSTKSIZE = 0xf0108000`. This matches the expectation: stack grows from higher address towards lower address.  
- The stack would look like 
    ```
    |               | 
    |               |   
    +---------------+  <-- bootstacktop 
    |               |   
    | KSTKSIZE bytes|          
    |               |  
    +---------------+  <-- bootstack
    |               | 
    |               | 
    ```
    And `bootstacktop` grows downwards towards boundary `bootstack`.

### Exercise 10
To become familiar with the C calling conventions on the x86, find the address of the test_backtrace function in obj/kern/kernel.asm, set a breakpoint there, and examine what happens each time it gets called after the kernel starts. How many 32-bit words does each recursive nesting level of test_backtrace push on the stack, and what are those words?

Disassemble the function and refer to `kernel.asm`.

```
During the function call: Push `%ebp` to stack in function prologue (4 bytes), `sub $0x8,%esp` allocate 8 bytes on the stack (8 bytes), then push caller-saved registers` %esi` and `%ebx` to stack (4 + 4 = 8 bytes), as they are used for calculating input for `cprintf`. Then it pushes arguments to the stack (4 + 4 = 8 bytes) and calls `cprintf`. After return from `cprintf`, `add $0x10,%esp` is used to free all memory allocated on stack to call `cprintf`, so at this point, the stack has grown by 4 + 8 = 12 bytes in total.  
Then `test_traceback` is called, the return address is implicitly pushed on the stack (4 byte), and jump to `<test_backtrace+85>`. 12 bytes are allocated on stack by `sub $0xc,%esp` and `%eax`(containing value of `x-1`) is pushed to stack as argument for `test_backtrace(x-1)`. So each nesting call to `test_backtrace` causes: 12 + 4 + 12 + 4 = 32 bytes = 8 words to be allocated on stack.  

> Note: initially I made 2 mistakes when calculating how much the stack grows for each nesting call. Firstly, I mistakenly mix `sub $0x8,%esp` and the following 2 pushes. Secondly, I forget about the implicit pushing of return address to the stack when `test_backtrace` is called again. And my previous, wrong answer is 5 words.

And we see its is pushed onto the stack. This corresponds to our observation before: on entry to the first call of `test_backtrace`, `%esp = 0xf010ffcc`. 
Consider the stack involved in the first call to `test_backtrace(x=5)`, an 8-word block:

### Exercise 11
Implement the backtrace function as specified above. Use the same format as in the example, since otherwise the grading script will be confused. When you think you have it working right, run `make grade` to see if its output conforms to what our grading script expects, and fix it if it doesn't. After you have handed in your Lab 1 code, you are welcome to change the output format of the backtrace function any way you like.

You can do it entirely in C, but you may find the `read_ebp()` function in `inc/x86.h` useful. You'll also have to hook this new function into the kernel monitor's command list so that it can be invoked interactively by the user.

The backtrace function should display a listing of function call frames in the following format:

```
Stack backtrace:
ebp f0109e58  eip f0100a62  args 00000001 f0109e80 f0109e98 f0100ed2 00000031
ebp f0109ed8  eip f01000d6  args 00000000 00000000 f0100058 f0109f28 00000061
...
```
Each line contains an `ebp`, `eip`, and `args`. The `ebp` value indicates the base pointer into the stack used by that function: i.e., the position of the stack pointer just after the function was entered and the function prologue code set up the base pointer. The listed `eip` value is the function's return instruction pointer: the instruction address to which control will return when the function returns. Finally, the five hex values listed after `args` are the first five arguments to the function in question, which would have been pushed on the stack just before the function was called. If the function was called with fewer than five arguments, of course, then not all five of these values will be useful. (Why can't the backtrace code detect how many arguments there actually are? How could this limitation be fixed?)

The first line printed reflects the currently executing function, namely `mon_backtrace` itself, the second line reflects the function that called `mon_backtrace`, the third line reflects the function that called that one, and so on. You should print all the outstanding stack frames. By studying `kern/entry.S` you'll find that there is an easy way to tell when to stop.

**Answer**  
Refer to `entry.S`, you see
```
# Clear the frame pointer register (EBP)
# so that once we get into debugging C code,
# stack backtraces will be terminated properly.
movl	$0x0,%ebp			# nuke frame pointer

# Set the stack pointer
movl	$(bootstacktop),%esp

# now to C code
call	i386_init
```
So `$0x0` would be the ending point of tracing back. 

**Code**
```C
int
mon_backtrace(int argc, char **argv, struct Trapframe *tf)
{
	cprintf("Stack backtrace:\n");
	int* curr_ebp = (int *) read_ebp();
	int* prev_ebp;

	while(true) {
		prev_ebp = (int *) *curr_ebp;
		// If prev_ebp == 0x0, it means the current function 
		// is already the last function in the call stack, and
		// thus you print the info and return.

        cprintf("  ebp %08x eip %08x ", curr_ebp, *(curr_ebp + 1));
		cprintf("args");
		int *arg_p = curr_ebp + 2;
		for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
			cprintf(" %08x", *arg_p);
			++arg_p;
		}

		cprintf("\n");
		if (prev_ebp == 0) {
			return 0;
		} else {
			curr_ebp = prev_ebp;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
```

### Exercise 12
At this point, your backtrace function should give you the addresses of the function callers on the stack that lead to `mon_backtrace`() being executed. However, in practice you often want to know the function names corresponding to those addresses.

To help you implement this functionality, we have provided the function `debuginfo_eip()`, which looks up `eip` in the symbol table and returns the debugging information for that address. This function is defined in `kern/kdebug.c`.

Modify your `stack_backtrace` function to display, for each `eip`, the function name, source file name, and line number corresponding to that eip.

In `debuginfo_eip`, where do `__STAB_*` come from? This question has a long answer; to help you to discover the answer, here are some things you might want to do:

- look in the file `kern/kernel.ld` for `__STAB_*`  
- run `objdump -h obj/kern/kernel`
- run `objdump -G obj/kern/kernel`  
- run `gcc -pipe -nostdinc -O2 -fno-builtin -I. -MD -Wall -Wno-format -DJOS_KERNEL -gstabs -c -S kern/init.c`, and look at `init.s`.  
- see if the bootloader loads the symbol table in memory as part of loading the kernel binary  

Complete the implementation of `debuginfo_eip` by inserting the call to `stab_binsearch` to find the line number for an address.

Add a `backtrace` command to the kernel monitor, and extend your implementation of `mon_backtrace` to call debuginfo_eip and print a line for each stack frame of the form:

```
K> backtrace
Stack backtrace:
  ebp f010ff78  eip f01008ae  args 00000001 f010ff8c 00000000 f0110580 00000000
         kern/monitor.c:143: monitor+106
  ebp f010ffd8  eip f0100193  args 00000000 00001aac 00000660 00000000 00000000
         kern/init.c:49: i386_init+59
  ebp f010fff8  eip f010003d  args 00000000 00000000 0000ffff 10cf9a00 0000ffff
         kern/entry.S:70: <unknown>+0
K> 
```
Each line gives the file name and line within that file of the stack frame's eip, followed by the name of the function and the offset of the eip from the first instruction of the function (e.g., monitor+106 means the return eip is 106 bytes past the beginning of monitor).

Be sure to print the file and function names on a separate line, to avoid confusing the grading script.

Tip: `printf` format strings provide an easy, albeit obscure, way to print non-null-terminated strings like those in STABS tables. `printf("%.*s", length, string)` prints at most `length` characters of `string`. Take a look at the printf man page to find out why this works.

You may find that some functions are missing from the backtrace. For example, you will probably see a call to monitor() but not to runcmd(). This is because the compiler in-lines some function calls. Other optimizations may cause you to see unexpected line numbers. If you get rid of the `-O2` from GNUMakefile, the backtraces may make more sense (but your kernel will run more slowly).

This exercise is mainly about reading the existing code and the STABS documentations. I refer to the 2 answers:

stab_binsearch(stabs, &lline, &rline, N_SLINE, addr);
if (lline <= rline) {
    info->eip_line = stabs[lline].n_desc;
} else {
    return -1;

int
mon_backtrace(int argc, char **argv, struct Trapframe *tf)
{
	cprintf("Stack backtrace:\n");
	int* curr_ebp = (int *) read_ebp();
	int* prev_ebp;

	while(true) {
		prev_ebp = (int *) *curr_ebp;
		// If prev_ebp == 0x0, it means the current function 
		// is already the last function in the call stack, and
		// thus you print the info and return.

		eip = (uint32_t) *(curr_ebp + 1);

		cprintf("  ebp %08x eip %08x ", curr_ebp, eip);
		cprintf("args");
		int *arg_p = curr_ebp + 2;
		for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
			cprintf(" %08x", *arg_p);
			++arg_p;
		}

		cprintf("\n");

		// debugging info
		struct Eipdebuginfo info;
		debuginfo_eip(eip, &info);
		cprintf("        ");
		cprintf("%s:%d: ", info.eip_file, info.eip_line);
		cprintf("%.*s", info.eip_fn_namelen, info.eip_fn_name);
		cprintf("+%d\n", eip - (uint32_t)info.eip_fn_addr);

		// Check ending
		if (prev_ebp == 0) {
			return 0;
		} else {

		}
	}
	return 0;
}

    Early PCs were only capable of addressing 1MB of physical memory. The physical address space of an early PC would therefore start at `0x00000000` but end at `0x000FFFFF`. The 640KB area marked "Low Memory" (`0x00000000` - `0x0000FFFF`) was the only random-access memory (RAM) that an early PC could use.

    The 384KB area from `0x000A0000` through `0x000FFFFF` was reserved by the hardware. The most important part of this reserved area is the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), which occupies the 64KB region.

    Later PCs, for backward compatability, follows this layout. 
    
- Booting a computer  
    - BIOS  
        When BIOS runs, it sets up an interrupt descriptor table and other devices. After initialization, BIOS searches for a bootable device. 
    - Boot Loader  
        Hard disks are divided into 512-byte regions called `sectors`. A sector is the disk's minimum transfer granularity: each read or write operation must be one or more sectors. If the disk is bootable, the first sector is called the `boot sector`, since this is where the `boot loader` code resides. When the BIOS finds a bootable hard disk, it loads the 512-byte boot sector into memory at physical addresses `0x7c00` through `0x7dff`, and then uses a `jmp` instruction to set the `CS:IP` to `0000:7c00`, passing control to the boot loader. Like the BIOS load address(From `0xA0000` to `0xFFFFF`), these addresses are fairly arbitrary - but they are fixed and standardized for PCs.  

        Boot loader reads each section of the kernel from disk into memory at the section's load address and then jumps to the kernel's entry point.
